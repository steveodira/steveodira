👋 Hi, I’m Steve — but my friends call me Vostih.
At work, I go by many names: Cyberninja, Mapninja, Techninja — pick your fighter. They all reflect my passion for blending tech, maps, and code to make the world smarter.

💻 I’m a full-stack developer, fluent in Python and Java on the backend, and comfortable crafting clean, interactive interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🧠 I also dive deep into data analysis and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) — turning messy data into stories, and satellite images into solutions.

🚀 Curious what I’ve built?
Check out one of my projects:

Let’s build something that matters. 🌍✨
